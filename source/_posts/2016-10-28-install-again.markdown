something new:  
install git:  

	sudo apt-get install git

don't install from ppa anymore.  
install rvm: run the command from official website,the latest version,maybe not the stable version.  
install ruby:we don't use version 1.9.3 anymore，search the official website，the latest version,for exemple:2.3.1  the old version may got some problem when install the gem package.  
`rubygems bundle install`its address has change,the latest version is[Ruby China](https://gems.ruby-china.org)，we could check it out from the origin official website.
